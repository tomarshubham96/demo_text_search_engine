Carmel-by-the-Sea, which is often called simply Carmel, is a small town located in Monterey, California about 330 miles from Los-Angeles. This interesting town, which is located on the Monterey Peninsula, was founded in 1902. Carmel is known for its incredibly beautiful scenery and artistic history. The town residents devoted their lives to the creative and aesthetic art and built these fabulous houses. The town is known for its creative people, for example, several mayors of the town were artists, actors and poets. 

The history of fairy houses in Carmel-by-the-Sea is romantic and inspiring. Hugh Comstock came to Carmel to visit his sister and her husband, the artists and members of the Art Association, and met Mayotta Brown, successful and creative person who was selling her designer dolls “Otsy-Totsys”. They got married the same year, and Mayotta asked Hugh to build a small cottage that could have been used as a showroom. Hugh was neither a builder nor the architect, but inspired by the illustrations of the children’s fairy tales, he designed and built with Mayotta a fairy cottage. The citizens of Carmel liked the cottage so much that they asked Hugh to design their houses and shops. And the history of fairy houses of Carmel began. Hugh’s houses inspired builders and architects; Hugh was called “a builder of dreams”. 

While travelling around US and California go and see these fairy and fabulous houses in a magical town. It goes without saying that you will find creative inspiration and will be fascinated by its magic and fantastic architecture.
