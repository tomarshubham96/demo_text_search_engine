Always repeat that you are not tired.

If you constantly think about how exhausted you are, it may make you feel more run down. 

1. Don’t sleep till noon.

Late mornings are not good for your body, because you stay off the timetable and the next evening you may have problems with falling asleep. 

2. Don’t pay attention to your carvings.

Fatty kinds of food require much energy to digest, leaving a person more sluggish. 

3. Mental activities should be followed by physical activities. 

After spending hours in front of your computer or TV, try to make some exercises, help your body to be restored. 

4. Drink coffee in the morning. 

It is known that caffeine is perfect for sleepy heads; it makes you feel more alert. 

5. Do not drink caffeine after lunch. 

Experts say that caffeine has a half-life of about 8-10 hours. This means that if you drink coffee in the second part of the day, half the amount of caffeine will still be felt at 8-10 p.m. 

6. Get outside.

Fresh air will surely help you to feel refreshed. Take a walk or ride a bike. Especially get outside on a sunny day, because sun stops the production of melatonin, the hormone that make you sleepy.
