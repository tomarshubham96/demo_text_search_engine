1. Write down everything
Take good notes during any business negotiations. To come to a business meeting without a notebook is considered unprofessional. 

2. Don’t overdress
Leave all the fashionable clothes in your closet. You should feel comfortable and natural in your clothes. 

3. All the gifts at the end
If you have prepared gifts or souvenirs for the participants of the meeting, give them after the meeting. It’s not ethical to give the gifts during the negotiations. 

4. Turn off the phone
Phone calls that interrupt the business meeting do not show your attention and respect. 

5. Control your behavior
Control your behavior; don’t play with a pen or stare at the ceiling, don’t draw on a piece of paper. Too relaxed pose in a chair is also considered unprofessional. Concentrate and pay attention to every word. 

6. Prepare yourself
Think over and write down the ideas you want to mention during a business meeting. Read them through before the meeting. This method will help you not to forget anything and will help you to look professionally. 

And finally, most important is to believe in your success. Be confident and may good success attend you!
