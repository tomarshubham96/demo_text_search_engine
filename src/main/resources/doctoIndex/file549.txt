Everyone loves unforgettable moments. Do you find sleeping with the sharks unforgettable? 

Hotel owners and travel agencies develop interesting programs in order to surprise and attract a greater number of tourists. The C?nr?d M?ldiv?s R?ngaliIsl?nd R?s?rt has been recently opened on the Maldives. This is a very extraordinary hotel; you can get to in only by a hydroplane. 

Forget about the usual rooms, here you will find real underwater apartments that amaze any traveler. You have the opportunity to dine in an underwater restaurant surrounded by the extraordinary marine life. During your meal you’ll be able to see extraordinary beautiful kinds of fish that swim around, different octopuses and even sharks. If you wish the dining hall can be transformed into a bedroom where you can fall asleep just like in a surreal dream surrounded by scary but fascinating sharks…
The restaurant with an overnight accommodation is designed for 12 people, so if you want to visit this extraordinary place, book it in advance. 
The cheapest room you can rent for $815 per night. Pleasant and unusual night to you!
