Lemon
Lemon is the most famous natural hair highlighter. Mix 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice with 3/4 cup of water. Pour mixture into a special spray bottle. Sprinkle it on hair, but be careful with the scalp. Leave the mixture on the hair for 2 hours, and 30 minutes of this time spend in the sun. Don’t allow the solution to get on your skin. Wash your hair and be sure to use a hair conditioner as lemon solution dries hair. 

Olive oil
Did you know that olive oil is the best natural hair conditioner? Moreover, it can be used as a natural highlighter. Generously rub olive oil into your hair and spend about an hour in the sun, and then wash off the oil. Your hair will not only be lightened, but perfectly hydrated! Repeat this procedure three times a week, until you reach the desired result. 


Chamomile tea
Believe it or not, chamomile tea can easily lighten your hair and give it golden color. Make a teapot with chamomile tea and let it stew and become cold. Apply it on the hair and enjoy the sun for 30-60 minutes. Repeat this procedure every day until you're satisfied with a color of your hair. 

Honey
Honey… though honey has a sticky structure, it can qualitatively lighten your hair. Apply honey on hair and leave the mask on for 2 hours. An alternative method is a mixture of honey, lemon and water. Apply this mixture on wet hair and spend several hours in the sun. It should be noted that the honey mask you will need to rinse twice. Honey gives the hair a variety of colors. 


Beer
Light beers are great for natural hair lightening. Make your hair wet with beer and leave the mixture on your hair for an hour. After rinse with cool water and moisturize with a conditioner. Repeat this procedure 2-3 times a week and enjoy the result.
