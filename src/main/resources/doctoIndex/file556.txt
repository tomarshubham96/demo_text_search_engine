C?nter for Environm?ntal Law & Policy organization (Yale University) decided to find out what is the greenest country in the world. 

As a result they came up with the list of Top 5 cleanest countries in the world. Number one in the list was Switzerland, then Latvia and Norway. As you know, Switzerland has been known as a country of the beauty and environmental friendliness. Here you’ll find not only the great climate and magnificent mountains, but also people who are doing everything possible to improve the ecological situation. 

Latvian citizens also try to maintain the ecosystem of the country. The nature of this country is very picturesque and environmentally friendly, so I strongly recommend going to this country and relaxing with the family. 

Norway can boast of clean air and clean water. This country has a low level of carbon dioxide emissions. Most of the locals use different eco-constructions. In Norway 98% of the electricity is produced by hydroelectric power plants. 

The fourth and the fifth place belong to Luxembourg and Costa Rica.
