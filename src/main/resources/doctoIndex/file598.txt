Most people think they know the key to a successful career: do not lift your head, work, avoid personal topics in the workplace at all costs. But experts say that these rules need to be changed. 

Avoid personal topics
Experts claim that any problems should be discussed and resolved openly. If you go round and round this problem productivity of the company suffers most of all, so it is important to resolve any problems, and even it’s a personal one. 

Developing a career
Nowadays there is a perception in the society that a person needs to earn more money, achieve career heights. But not every person wants and is ready for the responsibilities and power. Career doesn’t always give satisfaction. Therefore, this prejudice must be destroyed. It’s more important to be satisfied and enjoy your work. 

Do only what is included into your duties
It is not necessary to stay in the shade if you are sure that you have a lot of relevant and useful ideas for the company. Experts believe that such steps will be appreciated by your boss. 

Live in the office
For many of us, a career is not a passion of our lives. Therefore it is important to spend time outside of work; it will help facilitate our creativity at work. Find your hobby to help you relax and feel the unity with the world. 

Network 24/7
Nowadays the development of technology is very important for staying in communication with people. Use social media to stay in touch with the right people. Send short messages via Twitter or communicate with customers online. Online communication almost always guarantees a personal meeting, which will give the opportunity to resolve important corporate issues. At the end this networking will help you to move up the career ladder.
