Every dog owner wants his dog to be the best behaved dog in the world, he wants a dog not to have bad habits and listen on every command. Here are some training tips that every dog owner should know. 

Socialization
Socialize your dog as often as possible, and start to do it when he is small. By socialization we mean a walk outside your community and neighboring, meeting new people and situations. There is no such a thing as over-socialization. 

Reward your pet
Reward him for a good behavior! How will your dog know that he is doing right if you don’t tell him? Reward your dog when he peacefully lies at your feet (or doesn’t pull on the leash). It’s very important for a dog, because a dog starts to understand what is good and what is not. 

Be consistent
An important point in the dog training is schedule. Schedule of meals, walks, games and etc. Consistent communication system is the key to reducing anxiety for the dog, and for the members of your family. 

Watch your tone
Your tone sets the tune of the trainings. If you talk with your dog in the right way, your pet will respond quickly and correctly. Your voice should be calm and confident. 

Find a purpose
Every dog should have a purpose in life. Whether it’s a family dog or a guide dog, the purpose is important. It’s a key to a dog’s happiness.
