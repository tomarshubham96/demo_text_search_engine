It is said that at present nearly 50% of the working population on the Earth are women. Women work hard and try to receive leadership positions. For example, in the United States over the past 30 years, the number of working women has increased from 44 million to 72 million. 

Gender differences can and should be used for the benefit of companies. But there are four of the most dangerous problems in the workplace, which arise on the basis of sexual difference. 

1. Men and women have different understandings of the balance between work and personal life. 
According to a survey of 2400 women who hold leadership positions in Fortune 500 companies, women are often dismissed because of problems in his personal life. On the other hand, men prefer to choose work. 

2. Women seek the consent and the men are trying to find a quick solution. 
Women are trying to find a consensus, and are sympathetic towards others and try to provide support. Men usually do not like to do it. 

3. Men do a lot through friends. 
Once, the founder of LinkedIn Reid Hoffman said that a great number of contacts can be considered to be a new resume. Unfortunately, in some areas of life it is very difficult to get a position without the so-called contacts. It is known that the big businessmen prefer golf, which has almost become a must-have in the world of big business. Most women do not like this kind of sport. 

4. The dialogue that men and women lead is different. 
Men love to compete and ready to interrupt each other during the dialogue to express their position, while women prefer consent, listening to all points of view. 

Conclusion of the study is that both styles of communication are valuable in their own way. Therefore, a good company should have the correct ratio of the labor force.
