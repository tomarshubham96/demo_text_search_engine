Many of us spend our time wrongly. Think about it we start, when we realize that we haven’t achieved a lot in our life. This article is for those who want to change their lives. And for you, we suggest to start with, only two rules. 


Carry out a revision
Time is money; time is irreplaceable resource. You can develop yourself, your intelligence, improve health, but bring back the lost time is impossible. 

The main time thieves are social networks, the Internet, TV, a variety of games, phone, etc. 

It is important to know what you spend your time on, so we advise to write down everything that you do. Chances are high that you’ll be terrified with the results. 

Put everything in order: your timetable, your thoughts and your life. 

Make up a to-do-list
You can not expect changes to come without any effort. In order to see the changes in your life, begin to change your day. Make up a strict schedule of your doings. But in order to do this you need to set priorities. Pay special attention to the doings that are important and urgent. 

Urgent doings also try to do right away, but try not to spend a lot of time. 

Try to find a specific time for non-urgent, but important doings and try to resolve them step by step. 

And it’s much better to forget about non-urgent and not important doings. They even don’t deserve your attention. Very often problems are resolved without requiring any effort. 

Several additional tips: 

• it is better to do something one more important than a lot of non-essential things; 

• do not be engaged simultaneously in several important things - it’s difficult to focus on all of them; 

• try to plan your doings for a month, a week and for a day. Write down everything that should be done tomorrow; 

• Delete all the things that have been done;
