Try to write on a piece of paper whatever you want, the first that comes to your mind, and you will notice that for some reason the letters are clumsy and remind circles and sticks more than letters. It happens because most of us practically don’t write letters on paper, we mostly type on the keyboard. But, despite the modern technologies, an educated person should be able to write by hand. It should be noted that it’s also important and useful. 

3 Useful Qualities Why It Is Useful to Handwrite

The fact is that when you handwrite a certain part of brain is suscitated; it’s called reticular activating system. This system works as filter: when you handwrite, your brain considers this information to be important and activates. 

2. It helps to formulate your thoughts
Most well-known writers, in spite of the advanced technologies, prefer to handwrite, less prefer typing on the computer. It’s known that when you handwrite, it’s easier to tell down the stories. Scientists say that the speed writing corresponds to the speed of your thoughts. On the keyboard the speed of typing is higher than the speed of your thoughts. 

3. It helps to stay focused
Unfortunately you can say a computer is a real killer of your time. Social networks, interesting apps, chats encroach a lot of time. Of course, no one says that Internet is bad, there are even studies that show that entertaining video increases employees’ productivity. But those breaks won’t do any good if you write a serious work. Scientists say that writing by hand keeps you focused on your work. While writing a letter you develop motor habits and visual memory.
