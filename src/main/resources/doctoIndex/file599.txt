When Jean-Claude Decaux was young he earned his living by pasting up ads in Paris. He didn’t earn a lot, but suddenly his business was considered to be illegal. He was in despair and an interesting idea came up to his mind that would allow to earn more and to improve the quality of the city life. 

The idea came up to his mind when he saw people on the bus stop soaked to their skin. He decided to propose free bus stop construction in exchange for the advertisement on it. 
Then he went with this proposal to the mayor of the city of Lyon and received the permission. The same day the largest company of street equipment installation was established. In 1999 the revenues of the company reached 1.4 billion. And what is most interesting, mainly the profits of the company come from advertisements. 
Street furniture from JCDecaux SA Company was installed in 1200 cities around the world. 

Over the years the company has expanded its proposals from bus stops to kiosks, newspaper stands, road signs, benches and litter bins. 

Now Decaux runs his company with his two sons, Jean-Charles and Jean-Francois. Decauxs is satisfied with his life. His story proves again that if a person wants to change his life he surely can do it. 

Believe in yourself and achieve success!
