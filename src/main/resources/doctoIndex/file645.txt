Did you know that, in fact, white chocolate is not real chocolate? It consists of sugar, cocoa butter and milk solids. 


All the kinds of chocolate have the same way of the concoction. Of course, they differ in the quality, type or manufacturer, but in general they are similar. 
And at the same time chocolate has the distinctive cocoa smell. 

The consistency of while chocolate is similar, but it has very sweet taste that is actually far from the cocoa taste. 

According to experts, it’s because white chocolate is not chocolate at all. Diego Badaro, chocolate manufacturer, says that white chocolate doesn’t contain cocoa solids but only cocoa butter. The recipe of the chocolate doesn’t contain chocolate liquor extracted from cocoa. 

White chocolate may be called chocolate if it contains not less than 20% of cocoa butter. But many manufacturers use vegetable oil instead of cocoa butter, and the taste differs significantly. 

Real white chocolate is rich and creamy and tastes like chocolate because in addition to 20% of cocoa butter, the chocolate has minimum of 15% milk powder and a maximum of 55% sweetener. 
Only such a product, according to Diego Badaro, may be called chocolate.
