Going on a trip do not forget that there are different morals and rules of life in those countries, and do not try to set up your own rules of life. 

Japan 
In Japan, for example, you should hold the chopsticks headward, they must not be crossed or you shouldn’t point with them. You can’t stick them vertically into the bowl with the rice, because the Japanese do so only during the funeral. 

Ireland 
In Ireland, it is not necessary to say that Ireland is just one of the islands of Great Britain; after all you will deeply insult any Irishman. 

Iran
In Iran raised thumbs up do not mean appreciation, just on the contrary this is a sign of a rude and dirty insult. 

Thailand 
In Buddhist countries it’s forbidden to touch the head, even if it is the baby's head. According to their beliefs, the head is sacred because the soul lives there. If touching the head, you will really offend people. 

Indonesia
Do not try the traditional and local clothes in Indonesia. First of all, because you will insult the locals here, and secondly, you can be fined for this. 

Muslim countries 
Islam doesn’t allow drinking alcohol in Muslim countries. Muslims even if they drink, they do not do it in public. Therefore, you can’t give them a souvenir of alcoholic beverages, because this action will offend a Muslim and remind him of his sin. 

Be mindful of the traditions and customs of distant lands, but do not forget to enjoy your stay in these exotic countries! Have a great trip full of experiences and great emotions!
