Scientists have found out that poor female sleep negatively affects not only woman’s mood and well-being but also happiness of the family. Poor sleep has negative influence on female population because they are more emotional and are apt to hormonal discontinuity. 

Women themselves admit that after a bad sleep they become irritable and vapourish and effusive. Curiously enough, but the quality of the male’s sleep doesn’t affect the marriage. According to Dr. Wendy Troxel, professor at the University of Pittsburg, women who don’t have normal sleep, woke up in depression state and it ended in family disagreements and quarrels. The same noticed their husbands. 

The study involved 32 couples at the age of 32 who suffered from sleep disorders. Scientists have studied the effects of positive emotions on the quality of human sleep and possible relation of the quarrels and poor sleep. It turned out that good rest affects the relationship quality much stronger than small quarrels during a day. This interdependence is still can’t be explained by the scientists, but Dr. Troxel believes that this study once again proves how men and women differ from each other, and if you have family problems you’d better take into consideration the gender of the person. 

Don’t forget that 90% of wives can’t fall asleep because of husband’s snoring, and in 50 years of marriage the average snoring husband takes away 4 years of his wife’s sleep. Snoring is considered to be one of the main causes of the mental diseases that should not be ignored but treated.
