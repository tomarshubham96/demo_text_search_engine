Very often, men and women understand the concept of "healthy living" in different ways, and refer to it in different ways. 

We have made up a list of habits that men should borrow from women and that are directly related to health. 

First of all, men should learn from women to monitor the condition of the skin, especially the need to pay special attention to moles, age spots and other growths. It is mandatory to go to the doctor’s if needed. 

The second important point is timely visits to the doctor; it's worth doing in order to be able to detect the disease at an early stage. Men need to learn to take preventive examinations. 

Men also need to learn to slop out their emotions. They must learn to talk and do not bury their feelings, you need to talk about them or express in any other way. 

Men who attend the gym and go in for sports should pay attention not only to the strength exercises, but also to aerobic exercise, which contributes to improving the work of the heart, as well as to the need to spend more time with cardiovascular machines. 

Specialists proved that men need to learn how to pamper themselves. Just like women, they need to look after the arms and legs. By doing manicures and pedicures, you promptly remove fungal infection. 

In addition, men just need to go to massages and spa treatments that help our body to relax. These procedures improve blood circulation, help to eliminate harmful toxins from the body, relax the muscles of the body and strengthen our overall health. 

Pamper yourself, dear man, and be healthy!
