Every woman needs to understand that it’s much easier to work in the men's team, but there are also different pitfalls. In order to be a successful employee in the men’s team you need to know a few rules that will help you achieve career growth and success. 

Be sure to pay attention to your appearance
You are a woman and also a beautiful part of a man’s team, so you should always be on top. Pay attention not only to your appearance, clothing, etc., but also to your manners, which must also be impeccable. 

Correct and polite behavior is the key to success
In any situation, even in a conflict, behave ethically and responsibly. Do not let out your liberties and rudeness, which will diminish you in front of your male staff. 

Never humiliate a male colleague, especially in front of others
Do not humiliate your colleague publicly. It is not necessary to do this, even if he gives rise. If you have a conflict situation with one of your colleagues, try to resolve it privately without others. 

Do not be on the pitch
Never be on the pitch, especially in the men's team. Even if you have excellent professional qualities, affordable behavior will only disregard and disrespect from the colleagues. 

Be prepared to work hardly
You will need to prove constantly that you have received the praise not because you look great as a woman, but because of a job that has been done perfectly. Be prepared to work longer hours to prove that you are capable. 

Be part of a team
Try to become a member of the team, not the leader or a hermit. Men tend to play team games and do not like arrivistes. 

Do not let feminine emotions to come outside
Never allow woman's emotions to come out. Your main character trait in the men's team should be professionalism. Not a single man appreciates tears or complaints about the woman's fate. Only professional qualities and a friendly attitude are important. Good luck!
