Euthanasia:- Mercy Killing

 

“Euthanasia means an action which aims at taking the life of someone at his expressed request. It concerns an action of which death is the purpose and the result.” This delimitation applies only to voluntary euthanasia and excludes the non voluntary or involuntary euthanasia, the killing of a patient without the patient’s knowledge or consent. Some call this “life-terminating treatment.”

Euthanasia or ‘mercy killing’ is the direct intentional killing of a patient with either their consent without their consent when impossible or without consent but not sought. Many patients are in immense suffering and may be led to choose death as the answer by these ‘doctors’, friends or relatives. The culpability for the patient, in these cases May or relatives. The culpability for the patient, in these cases may Be lessened, but, this act of killing can never be justified. These patients, whether having an incurable disease, being elderly, or suffering in other ways, are crying out for help and love.

As humans we cannot always see the answered and for that reason, it is not we to decide about the death of a human being, god has not given us this authority. We must also ask ourselves concerning euthanasia; where will it end? If we allow the elderly or incurable to be assisted in suicide, what other groups will be given this right. Will the handicapped or mentally retarded be next? Will teenagers, who are the leading age group of suicide, also have this ‘right to die’?

The answer rests in our hands. If we continue to disrespect human life and its creator, God, then we will destroy ourselves. A right is a moral claim and since we do not have a claim on death, which itself has a claim on us, we cannot act for the right we don’t have. Perhaps Mother Teresa was right when she said that “if a mother can kill her own child, what is there to stop you and me from killing each other?”
