According to the Daily Mail scientists have recorded the fact that reading improves the brain functions. 

During the reading, scientists have been able to commit changes in the functioning of the cerebral cortex. It should also be noted that this effect persisted over the next few days. 

The leaders of the study suggest that it is still unknown how the formation and establishment of our personality is done with the help of reading books. But these recent studies have focused on the study of the processes that occur in the brain during and after reading books. 

In the recent experiment 12 students took part who read the works of Robert Harris' Pompeii every day for 19 days. This book was chosen because it is considered to be one of the most powerful and intensely filled. 

The study showed that the next day after reading of 30 pages of the book, the part of the brain that is responsible for language use, became more active. 

The researchers also say that reading books helps to improve muscle memory. 

That's why the researchers concluded that reading books have a positive impact not only on our psyche, but also on the physical well-being of a person in general.
