Sam Walton opened his first small store when he was 27 in 1945, the store was opened in town of New Pork, Ark. At that time it seemed that the whole town gathered together to watch the presentation of the unknown at that time franchising company “Ben Franklin”. They gathered there not because they hadn’t been able to see such smalls before, but they wanted to see who had dared to compete with Mr. Sterling – the owner of the major store in the town. The citizens saw the presentation of a small store and went shopping to the store that belonged to Mr. Sterling. 

The beginning wasn’t successful. But at that moment a young trader realized that you need to…smile. He personally met the customers and talked to them as if this store had been opened for this person personally. Sometimes Sam had been talking for hours to each visitor. They talked about everything: about a year-old son Robson, about life, about weather… And less that in a year angry Sterling gave Sam Walton the leadership in all financial aspects. 

Walton borrowed money, bought for his store an ice cream tray and for the first time felt the taste of success. The kids lined up in long lines to get a delicious ice-cream.
