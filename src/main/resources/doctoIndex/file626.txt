1. Say "and" instead of "but" because "but" negates everything that has been said up to this, including the facts that were good. 

2. Do not use rough "No", because your negative tone can negatively affect your companion. 

3. Develop the ability to ask open-ended questions and do not settle for monosyllabic replies. 

4. Use in your vocabulary the phrase "From that moment on, I ..." instead of "If I ...", since the latter expression means regret about what happened and rarely helps to move on. 

5. Say "I will do" or "I would like to do..." instead of "I have to do", which is associated with coercion and pressure. 

6. Use such phrases as "I recommend you," and not "You have to." Again, the words "must and have" put pressure on your companion and do not give the possibility to choose and decide. 

7. Discard the negative forms, better speak positively. 

8. Use in your vocabulary the so-called motivational denial. For example, "What you said is not quite right," "In this matter, I disagree with you." Motivating denial is best used in situations where you need to communicate something unpleasant, and such expressions can do that in a more polite form. 

9. Ask concrete questions with the words "when" and "how", as it will help to avoid one-word answers "yes or no". 

10. Include the public on the conversation, do not speak from the first person, and use the pronouns "you" or "We". If you keep talking from the first person, then you push yourself to the forefront, and these pronouns concentrate attention on the interlocutor.
