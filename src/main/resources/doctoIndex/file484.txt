IRON WIRE SCULPTURES CREATED BY MATTIA TROTTA

We offer you to take a look at amazing art created by the sculptor named Mattia Trotta. He creates his sculptures out of wire and iron chains. 

Mattia was born in 1980 in Savona. His mechanical education has helped him to become familiar will all the characteristics of metals. Art has captured Trotta in 2002. Through the sculptures he tries to share his own vision of the world. Mattia creates not only exhibition and personal projects but also is known for creating beautiful theatrical scenery. Mattia Trotta considers himself to be a master of his work, because he has perfect knowledge about metals. In addition to metal, Trotta uses marble as a foundation for his sculptures. Although all the materials the sculptor works with are modified in the process of transformation, but mattia doesn’t use soldering or welding, working only by hand. 

His sculptures are created slowly and carefully. First he draws the sketches of the new sculptures and then chooses the material and only after all that begins to create the next masterpiece. 

At first he creates a steel frame and then uses the chains, creating a silhouette of the sculpture. 

Mattia says that his work is similar to the work of a tailor, because every thread, whether cloth or iron, has its place. This is the only way to share emotions and feelings with people. The artist creates shades by special chemicals that can accelerate the natural corrosion. 
Surprisingly, all the details of the sculptures are very strong. Mattia is sure that the emptiness as well as the density, has a special significance. 

In an interview Mattia Trotta has added that the exchange of the information, emotions and thoughts is bound together in one chain. My chain sets the speed and the rhythm in order to capture the light and the shadow, the air and the substance, peace and chaos, the sky and the earth…
