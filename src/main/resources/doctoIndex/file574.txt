Unfortunately, the number of divorces nowadays around the world increases significantly. 

In US the average divorce rate is 45.8%. In other parts of the world statistics also shows disappointing numbers. But why is this happening? Why do marriages fall apart? It’s difficult to understand because every person in the world dreams of a family, comfort and happiness. Many couples try to overcome a lack of understanding in their relationship. Scientists from the University of California have studied the power of good words and its influence on human relationships. Couples that express their gratitude towards each other become closer and feel happier. This small experiment lasted for 9 months and 50 couples participated in it. During the study they periodically filled in questionnaires, wrote their own diaries where they expressed their attitude towards the partner. The results of the study showed that those couples who showed respect for each other and used the word “Thank you” became closer to each other. 

More often show respect and gratitude towards others, more often show love and then your partner will never file the divorce papers.
