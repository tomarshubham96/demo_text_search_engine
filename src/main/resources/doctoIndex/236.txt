When you’ve found your purpose, boredom doesn’t exist anymore

“Life is never made unbearable by circumstances, but only by lack of meaning and purpose.”

Viktor E. Frankl

When I had a job I didn’t like I was bored all the time. The only thing I did was getting ready for work, resting from a long workday, looking forward to the weekend and dreading Monday. My whole life revolved around a job I didn’t like. So what do you do when you get bored? Like most people, I did everything to avoid boredom.

I watched almost every single good TV show and movie that came out. I talked about those endlessly with people. I even spent hours on IMDB and Wikipedia to read about the actors. It’s all useless information!

Looking back, I think, “What was I doing?” Here’s another one. I also wanted to do something every single weekend. Go out to a restaurant or visit a different city. I just wanted to be busy with nonsense all the time. Now, those activities are not useless by themselves. I still love to go to restaurants.

The problem is when you become addicted to spending your time in a certain way. You get restless when you don’t plan something. Even if it’s not useful. That’s when we risk becoming too busy and wasting all of our free time. It’s such a waste.

With so much time on our hand, what should we do with this sea of time? Don’t underestimate time, it is your most valuable asset. While money comes and goes, time doesn’t. Once you lose time, you can never get it back.

When you are never bored a single moment in your life, you have found your purpose. You spend every waking minute on your purpose. Therefore, boredom doesn’t exist. You do not waste your time anymore with meaningless activities.
