I’m not a fan of motivational quotes. But getting motivated is not always easy. We have so many goals that we want to achieve.

Some many books to read. Some much stuff to do. But we have so little time, so we need to motivate (and inspire) ourselves to keep doing the things that satisfy us—and not waste our time.

Here’s a list of motivational quotes that always get me off my but. I found that it works best to print your favorite quotes and place them somewhere you see them multiple times a day. For example, I have motivational quotes on my monitor, desk, closet, the dashboard of my car, bathroom.

The quotes are in no particular order.

I hope you enjoyed these motivational quotes. I know that these just give you a temporary energy boost. If you use these quotes that way, that’s great. But the last thing you want is to rely on a bunch of motivation every day.

True motivation must come from within. So use these motivational quotes just to get started. Now, keep going with your own motivation.
