The world is full of useless things, on the creation of which was spent a lot of time, effort and money. 
But there are still things on the creation of which scientists are still struggling. 

1. A device that records dreams
Many believe that it would be great if there was a device that would be able to record dreams, which could be viewed on a big TV screen. For someone it might be amusing comedy, and someone would have been the director of "adult films." So, inventors, go for it... 

2. Clothing that is always clean and fresh
No one can imagine themselves living without a washing machine. But inventors are working to create fabrics that will remain clean and spotless for a long time. It seems to me that developing nanotechnology will be able to help. After all, there are already small tissue samples, which are cleaned by the sun and the wind. 

3. Cream that will cure everything
It would be good to have the cream, the ingredients of which could cope with any injuries. But, most of all, it is not possible. 

4. Battery with a never ending charge
The selection of modern technology is huge, but all this technology has one drawback ... the battery that is always discharged. We would like to have the battery that has a never-ending charge. 

5. Automatic device which can extract oxygen from hydrogen
All of us know and understand that the supply of oxygen is essential for our life. It would be ideal if there were a device that extracts oxygen from hydrogen. Divers will be really thankful for this device!
