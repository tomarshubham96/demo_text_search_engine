Dogs can not only be the best friends but also great doctors! A group of British scientists led by Andrew Huffner conducted a study which proved that “four-legged friends” can help its owner to relief pain in some situations. 
If a person suffers from diabetes, the dog can recognize the smell of low blood sugar and with the help of barking or movements can remind the owner to take medicine. 
If a child has autism, the dog may even the aggressive and restless behavior of the child. 

The best breeds that help to even the behavior are Ksolo dogs or they are also called Mexican Hairless. This dog with no hair can be kept by anyone. Dogs lean against unhealthy people and try to warm them up. 
Good helpers for those who suffer from dementia will be Retrievers and Labradors that may help patients to remind to make medications, meals or about going to bed. In addition, the dog perfectly removes a sense of excitement and fear.
Scientists emphasize that dogs can be easily trained and are happy to contact with patients. 

Love our little friends!
