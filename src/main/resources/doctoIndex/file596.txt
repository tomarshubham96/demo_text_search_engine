For many graduates life doesn’t go the way many of them have planned. To find a decent job at the competitive labor market becomes very difficult. Instead of registering at the unemployment center we propose to consider a part-time job that has many benefits. 

Firstly, this job will help you to gain some experience. Secondly, this job will bring some money that will help you to be more independent. 

Filling the gaps in your CV
Part-time job shows to the employers that you take this job seriously. Part-time job gives you the same responsibility as the full-time job. This job will help you to fill in the gaps in your CV. 

Gaining the experience in the chosen field
Part-time job introduces you to the chosen field of activity. Perhaps this job will give you the opportunity to meet the right people who can be helpful for you in future. For many employers the previous experience of the candidates plays a great role. Having experience in the chosen field (even if it was a part-time job) is more attractive to the employer than the lack of the experience in this area. 

Improved time-management and organizational skills
Part-time job will teach you to manage your time. You’ll be able to learn how to devote time to work and to the search of new full-time job. This experience of time management in the future will help you to manage time at your new job. People, who do not do anything and do not have a job, very often feel disorganized, because they do not have any obligation. Part-time job is the possibility to be prepared for work. 

Part-time employment shouldn’t be seen as a punishment but as an opportunity to grow professionally. After all, part-time position can turn into a full-time at any time. The key in any job is the responsibility that you feel, and, of course, the managers will notice it.
