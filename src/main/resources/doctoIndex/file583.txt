A well created CV is a half of the battle. What line will make a hiring manager to understand that you are the one who they need? What to write, and should be left out in your CV? 

Here are five things which should be left out from your resume: 

1. Objective: The objective, which begins by stating what you want to get a job in this company, is not correct. The employer understands that if you have submitted your resume you want to work. But if you do want to include this paragraph is your resume, focus on your skills and other achievements that should be taken into consideration. 

2. Recommendations: A list of recommendations implies that your employer may at any time ask you to show them. Instead of this paragraph create a separate document, which lists all of the recommendations and contact information. Be prepared to send the document by e-mail if it is requested by the employer. 

3. Outdated or irrelevant information: CV is your quality number, not quantity. So do not try to describe all your accomplishments on three pages, because no one will read it. Remove all the information that is outdated or is considered to be old and irrelevant. Instead, focus on a description of your education and experience that are of great importance. 

4. Personal qualities: If your future work is related to the modeling business then you just need to attach a picture to the resume. In all the other cases the employer does not have the right to ask you about your personal data relating to height, weight, religion, etc. 

5. False information: It goes without saying that we should not gloss over our abilities. Be honest while preparing the resume. After all, every employer has the right to check the veracity of your information.
